# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning projects repository! Here you'll find a collection of various ML projects, including competitions I've participated in on Kaggle. These projects range from data exploration and visualization to the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

## What's inside:

- Kaggle competition solutions and notebooks
- Supervised and unsupervised learning projects
- Feature engineering and model optimization techniques
- A variety of machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference or inspiration for your own projects. Each project folder contains the relevant notebooks, scripts, and any additional documentation or resources.
